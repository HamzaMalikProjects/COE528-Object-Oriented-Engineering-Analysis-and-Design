# 🏗️ COE528 – Object-Oriented Engineering Analysis & Design

**Course:** COE528 – Object-Oriented Engineering Analysis and Design  
**Institution:** Toronto Metropolitan University  
**Focus:** Requirements Engineering, UML Modeling, Design Patterns, Test-Driven Development  

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains lab assignments and projects for **COE528**, centered on the analysis, design, and implementation of complex engineering systems using object-oriented methodologies. Students develop requirement specifications, model system architectures with UML, and implement modular, reusable software in Java.
